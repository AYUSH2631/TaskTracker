# Task Tracker Application

## Project Description

The **Task Tracker Application** is a backend service designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Developed using **Spring Boot**, this RESTful API allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks with ease. 

### Key Features
- **Task Management**: Users can create new tasks, update existing ones, and delete tasks when they are no longer needed.
- **Task Retrieval**: The application supports fetching all tasks, or filtering them based on their priority or ID, making it easy to find specific tasks.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms ensure that users receive meaningful feedback for invalid requests or operations.
- **Unit Testing**: JUnit tests ensure functionality, especially for priority-based search and task management.


### Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework utilized for building the RESTful API and managing application configurations.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For handling data persistence and interactions with the database.
- **Database**: An in-memory database used for development and testing, providing quick access to task data.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation tool.
- **Unit Testing**: JUnit 5 for testing services


The application serves as a solid foundation for task management features, making it suitable for integration with frontend applications or as part of larger systems. It emphasizes good software design principles, making it easy to extend and maintain.
